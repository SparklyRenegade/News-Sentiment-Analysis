# News-Sentiment-Analysis  

## Project Overview
News Sentiment Analyzer is a Python-based project that allows users to input a news domain (e.g., sports, politics, technology) and then web scrapes the latest news headlines from that domain. The project then performs sentiment analysis on the scraped headlines and returns the sentiment results to the user. This tool helps users quickly understand the overall sentiment in the news for a specific domain.

## Features
- **User Input:** Users can specify the news domain they are interested in.
- **Web Scraping:** The tool scrapes the latest news headlines from a specified source.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** It performs sentiment analysis on the headlines using a pre-trained NLP model.
- **Results:** The sentiment analysis results are returned to the user, indicating whether the news is positive, negative, or neutral.
